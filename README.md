# DougleyBot 2.0 beta
[ ![Codeship Status for SteamingMutt/DougleyBot2.0](https://codeship.com/projects/d0626130-8ac5-0133-4246-7246c649b408/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/123527)

This is a rewrite of DougleyBot 1.0, featuring new functions and other things.   
Keep in mind that this is in **beta**, you can use this bot as any other Discord bot, but this one is not as stable.

If you still want to use this bot, the process of running it is the same as DougleyBot 1.0, with the difference that this bot needs [Redis](http://redis.io/).
